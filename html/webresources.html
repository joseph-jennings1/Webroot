            This is my holy grail of helpful websites for coding. Not only does it show examples of seemingly everything,
             but it gives you practice boxes to test out the code you are trying. Although this site does not always
             provide a ton of depth, it shows you the basics of how almost anything in the programming universe works.<br>

            <li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a><br />
            Stack Overflow is a great resource and forum for those with coding problems and questions. It has large forum 
            sections that are full of people trying to fix their code, and I have used these forums as both an 
            active poster and a researcher. Although this is a vast well of knowledge, it can be very difficult to find
            exactly what you are looking for.<br>

            <li><p><a href="https://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a><br />
            CodeProject can also help you with your coding problems through its extensive message boards, but it
            also has a large section of articles about widely ranging topics in the computer science world. Whenever 
            I want to explore a new facet of coding, my first stop is CodeProject.<br>

            <li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">Programming Subreddit</a><br />
            The Programming subreddit on Reddit is completely user driven, and as such can have wildly varying content.
            That being said, it has so much content that you can find most topics when you search for them. I generally use 
            this site when I want to see what programming topics are on other people's minds as opposed to when I am searching
            for a specific solution to a problem.<br>

            <li><p><a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/">WildlyInaccurate</a><br />
            This site posts in-depth articles on various coding issues. I first discovered it when researching
            Git, and it has multiple well-thought out articles on the subject. It also has a projects page, listing
            the various (and usually open source) projects the author is currently interested in.<br>
